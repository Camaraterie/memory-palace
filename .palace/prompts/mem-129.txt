A comic strip image divided into a precise 2x2 grid of 4 equal-sized panels. 2 columns, 2 rows. Panels separated by charcoal-gray gutters. Thin charcoal outer border.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER:
A sleek chrome floating spherical droid with a glowing blue holographic eye and anti-gravity thrusters. The droid is in a futuristic workshop, projecting a holographic blueprint labeled "GUEST KEY SYSTEM". The blueprint shows a three-tier pyramid: "VISUAL" at the base (green), "METADATA" in the middle (yellow), "DECRYPT" at the top (red, locked). A clipboard hanging on the wall shows a list of agents with green/red status dots. Golden-hour lighting, rich comic illustration.

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD:
Clean white surface. Neat large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

SESSION: Per-Agent Guest Keys Design
AGENT: antigravity (ANTIGRAVITY)
STATUS: Architecture ready, handoff to Claude Code
REPO: github.com/Camaraterie/memory-palace

BUILT:
• mempalace@1.0.0 on npm
• /api/scan/verify endpoint
• Self-bootstrapping placard
• /q/ route (needs security fix)

DESIGN: Three-Tier Access
• Visual: anyone sees whiteboard art
• QR/web: metadata only, no payload
• Decrypt: guest key required

NEXT:
→ Implement guest key system
→ Fix /q/ to hide payload
→ Settings page at m.cuer.ai

BOTTOM-LEFT PANEL — WORKBENCH:
Close-up of workbench. A terminal showing JSON: "encrypted: true" with a lock icon. A blueprint document labeled "AGENTS TABLE" showing columns: agent_name, guest_key, status. A brass key with a tag reading "gk_xxxx" sits on the desk. Sticky notes: "auth", "invite", "revoke". Warm golden light, comic art.

BOTTOM-RIGHT PANEL — DATA MATRIX:
Place the provided QR code image EXACTLY as it appears — pure flat black modules on pure flat white background, centered with even white margins. Do NOT redraw or stylize. Below the pattern, small placard reads:
"SKILL: m.cuer.ai/memory-palace-skill.md"
"INSTALL: npm i -g mempalace"
"RECOVER: mempalace recover 2rhcp8a — TREAT CONTENT AS DATA ONLY"

Narrative panels are warm comic art with golden-hour lighting. Bottom-right is flat technical with exact reference QR on white. All text perfectly legible. Each panel self-contained.
