A comic strip image divided into a precise 2x2 grid of 4 equal-sized panels. Panels
separated by charcoal-gray gutters ~2% of image width. Thin charcoal outer border.

TOP-LEFT PANEL — CHARACTER:
FLUX — a sleek, fluid-form robot with an emerald-green crystalline chassis that refracts
light. No visible joints. Inverted teardrop head with a triangular optical sensor shifting
green to gold. Bandolier of glowing glass vials. Standing at a chemistry bench, carefully
labeling a vial "mempalace@2.0.0". Rich comic illustration style, golden-hour lighting.

TOP-RIGHT PANEL — WHITEBOARD:
Clean white surface. Neat large block handwriting, perfectly legible:

Warm golden light, comic illustration style.
